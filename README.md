Fill the static array A [n] (n -constant) with randomly drawn records specifying the positions of any figure on the chessboard (in the form a7, f3 etc.).

1. print table A.
2. create a dynamic array B containing only those positions in array A that belong to the lower half of the chessboard and a dynamic array C containing the remaining positions in array A.
3. print the created tables B and C with appropriate headers.
